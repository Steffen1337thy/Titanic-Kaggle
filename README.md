Kaggles Titanic Dataset


I have tried a "fast approach"

The goal of this attempt was to get relatively quick through the dataset,

identify the most important features and find a model that predicts based on that features.

Why the fast approach? Sometimes it might not necessary to go directly to the complete solution or to find the best model.

Sometimes someone might just need a quick indication. That's the reason why I tried on this one.

It was also very interesting, as the notebook also shows, that you need to be careful, even if you try to find a quick solution.

Currently I am also working on a second approach where I try to find the best model, also including feature engineering, etc.
